Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture
-
* John Carmack had an insatiable will of learn
* John Carmack spent considerable money buying knowledge (books, articles, scientific articles)
* John Romero gave challenges to push Carmack's technology further
* Create prototypes to experiment what technology is able to do
* Apogee as publisher (let id focus on game development, instead of sales, advertising, etc)
* Weekend "rent" SoftDisk's computers to build Mario PC's port demo (Dave in Copyright Infrigement) 
* Think out of the box. How John realized that he should just update/repaint part of the screen to be able to create a smooth side scrolling game (Dave in Copyright Infrigement)
* Past dayhat time, console platform (NES) was ahead if compared with PCs
* Lesson learned: several times they had something to show, something they did without earning anything. It would be nice to create things even if no money is garanteed
* Stay small as a team (7* ppl did doom)
* Share knowledge
